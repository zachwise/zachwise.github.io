                                    As the Trump administration continues to curtail funding for longstanding federal agencies like the EPA, citizens have taken it upon themselves to gather and contextualize the data formerly compiled by federal agencies. Scientists, academics and individuals have banded together to form save the data events to protect existing environmental data that has already been collected for fear it may be deleted or made inaccessible. This trend raises the question: Where will future data come from?

                            One possibility is for citizens and journalists to gather the data themselves.

                            In our research, we spoke with David Unger, an environmental journalist. According to Unger, the field of journalism is known for being slow to adopt new technology, and this includes emerging means and applications of data collection. Unger believes journalists should move away from “old-fashioned” data gathering and toward networked communications that can deliver more data at a faster rate. Even though gathering environmental data is “probably not the highest of priorities” under the Trump administration, Unger said, he has seen community activists take a more prominent role in their own data collection.

                                Journalists love learning and sharing. While, yes, there is a certain extent of sitting quietly and writing at one’s desk, there’s also a lot of fervent collaboration. No detail is too small to merit a second (or hundredth) glance. When you get excited over an intricate problem you solved, you’ll have people to share it with. And you’ll hear interesting stories from them.

                            SensorGrid aims to be an open-source, inexpensive method for collecting and understanding environmental data locally. Knight Lab’s SensorGrid was developed with underlying goals of promoting citizen science and democratizing data collection. The technology aims to use the emergence of DIY Arduino-based hardware to create a product that makes easily customizable and deployable environment sensing nodes that come ready to communicate with each other.

                            In considering the purpose and direction of the SensorGrid project, an effort was made to discover similar and related projects and to consider the role that SensorGrid might play in this broader ecosystem of options. The following table summarizes the projects that we found:
